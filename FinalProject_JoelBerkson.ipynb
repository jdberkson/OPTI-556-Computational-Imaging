        "In most display systems, whether it be LED screens, projectors, or even cameras, the brightness response is nonlinear compared to the true brightness desired/observed. This is typically represented as a gamma factor $I^\\gamma$, where linear response is $\\gamma$ = 1. Usually it is beneficial in display systems to have a gamma factor greater than 1, which will look more natural to our eye, but in some systems this is undesirable. If you desire to recover the inital image.\n",

One of the most common ways to recover this phase is through what's known as a the PSA LSQ (Least Squares):\n",
